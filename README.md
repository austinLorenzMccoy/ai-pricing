A sophisticated AI-powered engine for dynamic pricing of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). This system leverages large language models, market data, sentiment analysis, and economic indicators to generate accurate price signals for tokenized assets.

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Pricing**: Uses Groq's LLM models to analyze multiple data sources and generate price signals
- **Multi-Source Analysis**: Combines auction data, sentiment analysis, and economic indicators
- **Vector Knowledge Base**: Maintains an evolving knowledge base of market trends and asset information
- **RESTful API**: Clean, well-documented API built with FastAPI
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with containerization
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Pytest-based test suite for reliability

## 🏗️ Architecture

The RWA AI Pricing Engine follows a modular architecture:

```
ai_pricing/
├── api/            # API endpoints and FastAPI application
├── core/           # Core pricing engine and business logic
├── data/           # Data access and storage
├── models/         # Data models and schemas
├── services/       # External service integrations
├── tests/          # Test suite
└── utils/          # Utility functions and helpers
```

## 🛠️ Installation

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thebulls/ai_pricing.git
cd ai_pricing

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t rwa-ai-pricing .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env rwa-ai-pricing
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# API Configuration
API_TOKEN=your_api_token
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0
DEBUG=False
ENVIRONMENT=development

# AI Service Keys
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the API Server

```bash
# Start the API server
python main.py

# With auto-reload for development
python main.py --reload
```

### Running the Example

```bash
# Run the example usage
python main.py --example
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Root endpoint with basic information
- `POST /api/price`: Generate price signal for an asset
- `POST /api/datasource/update`: Update a data source
- `GET /api/assets/{asset_id}`: Get asset metadata
- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=ai_pricing
```

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The system collects data from various sources including auction platforms, sentiment analysis, and economic indicators.
2. **AI Analysis**: The Groq LLM analyzes the collected data to determine a fair market price.
3. **Price Signal Generation**: A price signal is generated with confidence score and influencing factors.
4. **Knowledge Base Update**: The system's knowledge base is continuously updated with new market data.

## 🔌 Integration

The RWA AI Pricing Engine can be integrated with:

- **Tokenization Platforms**: Provide real-time pricing for newly minted RWA tokens
- **Trading Platforms**: Support dynamic pricing for secondary market trading
- **DeFi Protocols**: Enable accurate collateral valuation for RWA-backed loans
- **Oracle Networks**: Feed price data to on-chain applications

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Enhanced sentiment analysis with specialized models
- [ ] Integration with more data sources
- [ ] Advanced anomaly detection for price manipulation
- [ ] Time-series forecasting for price trends
- [ ] Governance mechanism for pricing disputes
